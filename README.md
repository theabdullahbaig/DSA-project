This project is a high-speed command-line spell-checker built using C++ that relies on a hash table data structure to efficiently store and look up words. When you run the program, it first loads a dictionary file into memory by distributing all the words into a network of "buckets" using a special hash function. This function quickly translates a word into a numerical index, allowing the program to locate words in near-constant time, regardless of the dictionary size. When checking a text file, the program processes the text word by word, converts each word to lowercase, and then uses the same hash function to jump immediately to the correct bucket in the dictionary. It then checks that small list for a match. This approach ensures that the time it takes to check a word does not grow significantly as the dictionary gets larger, making the spelling check process incredibly fast.
